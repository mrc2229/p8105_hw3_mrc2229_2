Problem 1
=========

Bring in instacart data
-----------------------

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

Examining the instacart data
----------------------------

There are 1384617 observations in the instacart dataset and 15 variables in the instacart data set. Some of the key variables are product\_name, which shows the product purchased; aisle, which tells us the aisle the purchased item comes from; and order\_id, which tells us the id of the person who ordered a certain item. So we can see things like that person with order\_id 1 got 2 items from aisle 24, the fresh fruit aisle. The instacart dataset also gives information on the time an order was placed. As an example, the person with order\_id 1 made their order at the 10th hour of the day.

Examining the aisles
--------------------

There are 134 aisles in total and the most items are ordered from the fresh vegetables and fresh fruits aisles.

Plot of number of items ordered in each aisle
---------------------------------------------

``` r
items_per_aisle_plot = instacart %>%
  count(aisle,name="aisle_count") %>%
  filter(aisle_count>10000) %>%
  arrange (desc(aisle)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=aisle, y=aisle_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Ammount of Items Purchased in Each Aisle",
    x = "Aisle (alphabetical order from bottom)",
    y ="Ammount of Items Purchased"
  ) + 
  coord_flip()

items_per_aisle_plot 
```

![](p8105_hw3_mrc2229_2_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

-   This bar graph shows the most popular aisles for purchases. Aisles are in alphabetical order starting with baby food formula at the bottom and moving up to yogurt. The most popular aisles are largely the fresh vegetables and fresh fruits.

Table of most popular items in "baking ingredient", "dog food care", and "packaged vegatables fruits"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
most_popular_items = instacart %>%
  select(aisle,product_name) %>%
  filter(
    aisle == "baking ingredients"|
    aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits"|
    aisle == "dog food care"
    ) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name,name="product_count")%>%
  mutate(product_count_rank = rank(desc(product_count))) %>% 
  filter (product_count_rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, product_count_rank) %>%
  select(aisle, product_count_rank, product_name, product_count) %>%

-   This table shows the 3 most popular products for each of the Aisles baking ingredients, dog food care, and packaged vegetables fruits as well as the count of each product from that aisle.

Table showing day and time Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
pink_lady_coffee = instacart %>%
  filter(
  product_name == "Pink Lady Apples"|
  product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream"
  ) %>%
  arrange (product_name, order_dow) %>%
  mutate(
    order_dow = 
    recode(order_dow,
    "0" = "Sunday",
    "1" = "Monday",
    "2" = "Tuesday",
    "3" = "Wednesday",
    "4" = "Thursday",

-   This table shows the mean time of day that coffee ice cream and pink lady apples are ordered for each day of the week.

Problem 2
=========

Bring in and clean BRFSS data
-----------------------------

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health" |
  response == "Poor"|
  response == "Fair"|
  response == "Good"|
  response == "Very good"|
  response == "Excellent"
  ) %>%
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, "Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))
```

States with 7 or more locations
-------------------------------

``` r
state_locations = brfss_data %>%
  filter(year == 2002 | year ==2010) %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  summarise(number_of_state_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  filter (number_of_state_locations >= 7)
```

In 2002, 6 states had 7 or more locations.Those states were CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA.

In 2010, 14 states had 7 or more locations.Those states were CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA.

An "Excellent" response only dataset and spaghetti plot.
--------------------------------------------------------

``` r
excellent_data = brfss_data %>%
  filter (response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  mutate(ave_data_value = mean(data_value)) %>%
  select(year, locationabbr, ave_data_value) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=ave_data_value))+
  geom_line(aes(group=locationabbr, color=locationabbr))+
  scale_color_viridis(
    discrete = TRUE,
    name = "State Color Key"
  )+
  labs(
    title = "Average Data Value over Time within a State",
    x = "Year",
    y ="Average Data Value (%)"
  ) 
  
excellent_data
```

NY State distribution of data values for each responce type in 2006 and 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
NYS_data = brfss_data %>%
  filter(year == 2006 | year == 2010) %>%
  filter (locationabbr == "NY") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=locationdesc, y=data_value, fill=response))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")+
  facet_grid(~year)+
  labs(
    title = "Data Values for Responses among Locations for 2006 and 2010 in NY State ",
    x = "NY State County",
    y = "Response Percentages"
  ) +
   coord_flip()

NYS_data
```

![](p8105_hw3_mrc2229_2_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

-   This table compares the relative frequency of each responce type for each NY State county in 2006 and 2010. Note there was no 2006 data for Monroe County, Erie Country, and Bronx County.

Problem 3
=========

Read in and clean Accelerometer Data
------------------------------------

``` r
accel_data = read.csv("./hw3_data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_minute",
    values_to = "activity_count",
    names_prefix = "activity_"
    ) %>%
  mutate (
    weekday_or_weekend = case_when ((day == "Friday" | day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday") ~ "Weekend",
    TRUE ~ "Weekday"),
    activity_minute = as.integer(activity_minute)
  )
```

The accelerometer dataset contains 50400 observations and 6 variables. The data contains five weeks of accelerometer data and the "week" variable shows which of those five weeks that data was collected from. The "day" variable gives the day of the week and "day\_id" is a numeric identifier for a specfic day of the 5 week collecion of data. "activity\_minute" gives every minute of the day and "activity\_count" measures activity in that minute. "weekday\_or\_weekend" tells us if that day was a weekday or a weekend. The "weekend" is considered Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in this dataset rather than just Saturday and Sunday because in my opinion the weekend starts on Friday.

Activity over ever day
----------------------

``` r
day_activity=accel_data %>%
  group_by(day_id) %>%
  summarise("total_activity_for_day" = sum(activity_count)) %>%
  kable()

day_activity
```

-   It appears that activity is typically higher from about 10:00am to 1:00pm on Sundays and from about 7:30pm to 10:00pm on Fridays and Saturdays. Very late at night (after 11:00pm) and early mornings (before about 7:00am) for every day of the week seem to have the lowest activity.
